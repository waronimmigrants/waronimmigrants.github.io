<p>This talk will cover the increasingly repressive immigration policies of the European Union and its member states. From militarized responses to migrants at sea to the criminalization of rescue operations, third country return agreements, and border externalization, Europe has taken a sharp turn away from any commitment to refugee protection and fundamental rights.</p>
