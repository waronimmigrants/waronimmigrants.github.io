<h2>Talks</h2>


<hr>
<br>
<p>The first four talks have been focused on the US situation, exploring the separation of children from their parents as a tool for deterrence, mass criminal prosecutions for immigration violations, the terrorization of minority communities by immigration police and unchecked extremist groups, the retreat from refugee protection, the attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and the “Muslim ban” that Trump promised on his campaign trail. The talks have explored how the United States reached this point, including decades of self-reinforcing anti-immigrant policies and ballooning enforcement budgets under both Democratic and Republican administrations. They have provided overviews of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, highlighting the ways in which they differ from what has been seen previously, their impact on people’s lives, and ongoing efforts to challenge and resist them.</p>

<h4>13 June 2018</h4>
<p>Universitat Pompeu Fabra<br>
John Palmer, Sociodemography Research Group and Interdisciplinary Research Group on Immigration</p>

<p>This talk was offered in light of the dramatic escalation of anti-immigrant policies under the Trump administration, including the separation of children from their parents as a tool for deterrence, mass criminal prosecutions for immigration violations, the terrorization of minority communities by immigration police and unchecked extremist groups, the retreat from refugee protection, the attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and continued attempts to impose the “Muslim ban” that Trump promised on his campaign trail. The talk explores how the United States reached this point, including decades of self-reinforcing anti-immigrant policies and ballooning enforcement budgets under both Democratic and Republican administrations. It provides an overview of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, highlighting the ways in which they differ from what has been seen previously, their impact on people’s lives, and ongoing efforts to challenge and resist them.</p>
